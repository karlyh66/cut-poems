### what is this?
I used to love cutting words from newspapers to make little poems.
here is a digital version.
paste in an excerpt from your favorite book, or a news article, or a recipe, or...
or use an excerpt from one of my favorite books.
enjoy and [show me your poems](https://x.com/kbarley66) :)
